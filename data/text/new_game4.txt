You were a @profession_description@ in your past. However,
  few memories remain of your former self.
This area you are travelling in is called the Drylands.
It is to the east of the city of Peccatum, otherwise surrounded by the ocean.
As the name suggests, the climate is very dry.
There's not much else to be seen but sand.
Every now and then some lizards or scorpions pass by while travelling in addition to a few travellers.

You see a lizard observing you with keen eyes.
The lizard lunges toward you.
