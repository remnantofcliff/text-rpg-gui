You wake up...
The last thing you remember is that you were captured by the guards of Nilium.
Your memory feels hazy...
@TEXT 0
You are in a dark room.
You can't really see anything.
@TEXT 0
It's cold and damp in the room.
You are wearing rags that you don't recognize.
None of your possessions are on you.
There is a small amount of light coming through one part of the door.
@TEXT 0
As you get closer to the light,
you realize that it is shining through decrepit doorframes.
You open the door and see an outline of a person.
@TEXT 0
The person begins talking:
"Oh, you woke up already..?
I've been keeping watch on you while you were out.
You are just like the others...
Thrown in here, and left to die..."
@TEXT 0
"Be careful out there."
@TEXT 0
"There's nothing worse than seeing the people I save just die a gruelsome death..,
as many have..."
@TEXT 0
The man lights up a candle.
You can now see his face.
It is scarred and he has a stoic expression.
@TEXT 0
"You need to leave.
I don't have anything else for you."
@TEXT 0
You can't quite tell how old the man is due to the scars and damage he's suffered.
He shows you the way to the door that leads you to the outside.
@TEXT 0
He opens the door and says in a calming manner:
"There might be no getting out.
Many have tried,
and just as many have failed."
@TEXT 0
"This place is where criminals, fugitives, and heretics of Nilium are left to die."
@TEXT 0
You see a large cave out of the door.
The place is lit up by torches and you see a few people standing around.
@TEXT 0
"This is our little community here in the western corner of Dereliquerat.
All these people are too stubborn to die.
However,
we can't sustain any more people living here. 
Crops don't do too well down here..." he finishes with a smirk.
@TEXT 0
"See ya." He says with a smile and, in one swift motion, 
waves goodbye, 
turns around, 
and closes the door.
@TEXT 0
You can't remember your name...
How should you introduce yourself?
